# This is the script for plotting the results from a PyRate run (see master_script_plotting.sh/master_script_combined_plotting.sh)
# $1 where the output of a simple PyRate run
# $2 a txt file with the geological ages for the preservation rates
# $3 the number of burnin state you want to discard (see assess_run_convergence.py)
# $4 an output directory for the plotting
# $5 a txt file with the time bins
# $6 type of analysis (RJMCMC/BDS)
# $7 the location of Parsed_Q_rates files from the corresponding PyRate run
# All other arguments are either generated by this script or are associated with the folder for this analysis
